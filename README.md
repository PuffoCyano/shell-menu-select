# shell-menu-select

A script that allows a user to use arrow keys to select an item from a list.
Sometimes using `select` can be a bit clunky because the user doesn't get any
visual feedback about what they're selecting unless a confirmation message is
displayed (which adds more overhead).

## How to use
